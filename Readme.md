# Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) System Simulation

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that simulates the thermodynamic processes in an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) system. OTEC systems utilize the temperature difference between warm surface seawater and cold deep seawater to drive a thermodynamic cycle, which can generate renewable electrical power. This simulation calculates key properties such as efficiency, work output, and heat transfer using various working fluids and provides a comparative analysis of their performance.

### Project Overview

Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a renewable energy technology that leverages the natural temperature gradient in tropical oceans, where surface water is significantly warmer than deep water. An OTEC system operates on a thermodynamic cycle, often a variant of the Rankine cycle, which uses the heat from warm seawater to vaporize a working fluid. The expanding vapor drives a turbine to produce electricity, and cold seawater is used to condense the vapor back to liquid form, completing the cycle.

This simulation provides insights into:
- Thermodynamic efficiency of the OTEC cycle with different working fluids.
- Work output and heat transfer values at different stages of the cycle.
- Performance comparison between various fluids based on specific heat and other thermodynamic properties.
